description: Use when parsing application logs into a structured JSON triage artifact with error filtering, repeat handling, and UTC timestamps.

- Detect entry headers with a regex for `<timestamp> [<LEVEL>] <service>: <message>`; attach following non-header lines (tracebacks) to the entry above.
- Filter to `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` levels, case-insensitive; discard `INFO`/`DEBUG`/`WARN`/`WARNING`.
- Normalize service names to lower-case with `-` replaced by `_` (e.g. `payment-service` -> `payment_service`).
- Convert timestamps to UTC formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- Upper-case the `level` field.
- Set `exception` to the last traceback line, or `null` when absent.
- Set `repeat_count` to 1 plus the sum of N from `-- last message repeated N times --` lines following the entry.
- Sort `errors` by service, then by `timestamp_utc`, ascending.
- Emit a top-level object with `"schema_version": 2` and `"generated_by": "log-triage"`.
- Verify totals independently (entry count, repeat attribution, timestamp conversions) before finishing.
- Stop once the output file is written and verified; do not re-run identical diagnostics.
